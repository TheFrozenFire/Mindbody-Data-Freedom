Mindbody Data Freedom
=====================

This tool enables you to, selectively or in bulk, extract data stored within
the Mindbody service via their API.

Why?
----

There are a few reasons why you may want to do this. First and foremost, one
may decide to do this because they don't want their data potentially being
"stuck" in the Mindbody system, if their state of their contract with Mindbody
goes awry. Other reasons would include wanting to test in-house code on a set
of real data without having to clobber the API, or risk having bad code break
your data, or even just being able to convert the data to a format which you
can more easily work with in your application.

Legality
--------

Obviously I don't want to step on any toes, so if you're a representative of
Mindbody, and wish to speak with me, feel free to drop me a line. I'm a
"Champion" on the GetSatisfaction forum for Mindbody (currently the only one?),
so you can be sure I'm not providing this tool maliciously.

However, that being said, "data freedom" tools are quite commonplace for
online services which house a lot of data. It is the client's data, being
accessed via an openly-accessible API, and by default this tool will run
with "no clobber" settings in order to not expose the service to abnormal
levels of load.
